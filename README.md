# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user selection using NLP and cosine similarity.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project recommends movies by analyzing movie content such as:
- Overview
- Genres
- Keywords
- Cast

It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to find similarity between movies.

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset files are not included in this repository.

You can download the dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

Files used:
- tmdb_5000_movies.csv
- tmdb_5000_credits.csv

- ## 📦 Generated Files

The following files are generated locally and are not included in the repository:

- `movie_dict.pkl` – processed movie metadata
- `similarity.pkl` – cosine similarity matrix

These files can be regenerated by running the Jupyter notebook.

- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and merge movie & credits datasets
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Combine important features into a single `tags` column
4. Convert text into vectors using CountVectorizer
5. Calculate cosine similarity between movies
6. Recommend top 5 similar movies

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/app.py

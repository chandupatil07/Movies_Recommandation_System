# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **content-based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies based on user selection using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **cosine similarity**. The project is fully deployed using **Streamlit** and provides an interactive user experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

Finding movies similar to your taste can be difficult when there are thousands of options available. This project solves that problem by recommending movies based on **content similarity**.

The system analyzes the following movie attributes:

* Overview (story description)
* Genres
* Keywords
* Cast

Based on these features, it recommends the **top 5 most similar movies** to the one selected by the user.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

* **Recommendation Type**: Content-Based Filtering
* **Text Processing**: NLP (tokenization, text cleaning)
* **Vectorization**: CountVectorizer
* **Similarity Measure**: Cosine Similarity

This approach does not require user ratings and works purely on movie content.

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset files are not included in this repository.

📥 Download from Kaggle:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

**Files used:**

* `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
* `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

## 📦 Generated Files

The following files are generated locally after preprocessing and are not included in the repository:

* `movie_dict.pkl` – Processed and structured movie metadata
* `similarity.pkl` – Cosine similarity matrix

These files can be regenerated by running the preprocessing script or notebook.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
* Streamlit
* Jupyter Notebook
* TMDB API (for movie posters)

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. Load and merge movie and credits datasets
2. Clean and preprocess text data
3. Combine key features into a single `tags` column
4. Convert text data into vectors using CountVectorizer
5. Compute cosine similarity between movies
6. Recommend top 5 similar movies
7. Display results with posters and metadata using Streamlit

## 🚀 Features

* Interactive web interface
* Fast and accurate movie recommendations
* Displays movie posters, genres, and release year
* Handles missing posters gracefully
* Fully deployed and accessible online
